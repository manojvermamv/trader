## 🔎 What Happens When Prices Move with Volume and OI?

| Price      | Volume   | OI     | What It Means (Buyer View)                                                               |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rising  ↑  | Up   ↑   | Up   ↑ | **Fresh buying — strong trend** 🔥 BUY CALLs (CE)                                        |
| Rising  ↑  | Down ↓   | Down ↓ | **Short covering — weak rally** ⚠️ Avoid buying                                          |
| Falling ↓  | Up   ↑   | Up   ↑ | **Fresh shorting — strong fall** 🚫 Avoid buying, or Aggressive BUY PUTs (PE) with care  |
| Falling ↓  | Down ↓   | Down ↓ | **Longs exiting — fall may end** ⏳ Wait for trend reversal                              |

## ✅ When to Buy Options (CE or PE)?

### ✔️ Buy **CALL (CE)** When:
- Price rising
- Volume & Open Interest rising
- Put/Call Ratio (PCR) < **0.6–0.9**
- Implied Volatility (IV) is **low** (premium is cheap)

➡️ **Choose ATM or slightly ITM strike when:**
- Volume is high
- OI is building on Calls side
- Underlying index is showing strong momentum with breakout


### ✔️ Buy **PUT (PE)** When:
- Price falling
- Volume & Open Interest rising
- Put/Call Ratio (PCR) > **1.3–1.5** (overconfidence)
- IV is **low to moderate**

➡️ **Choose ATM or slightly ITM strike when:**
- PE OI is rising
- Strong downtrend on chart
- No support zone nearby


### ❌ Don’t Buy When:
- Price up but Volume & OI down (short covering)
- OI dropping on both CE and PE (trend exhaustion)
- IV is high (premiums are overpriced)
- Rangebound market (time decay loss)
- Far OTM options with low volume & low OI (they lose value fast!)

## ✅ Ideal Strike Selection in a Slow Positive Market

| Criteria                  | Recommendation                      | Why                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 📊 **Most Traded**        | ✅ Yes (high volume = liquidity)     | Easy to enter/exit, tighter spreads      |
| 📈 **Highest OI**         | ✅ Yes (confirms market interest)    | Confirms conviction in price direction   |
| 💰 **Strike Type**        | ✅ ATM or 1-step ITM                 | Safer delta, better ROI in slow movement |
| 🧭 **Time to Expiry**     | ✅ Choose with **5+ days to expiry** | To reduce theta decay impact             |
| 📉 **Implied Volatility** | ❌ Avoid if IV is **very high**      | Overpriced premium = poor reward\:risk   |

│    ├── < 0.9 → Bullish → Buy CE
│    └── > 1.3 → Bearish → Buy PE
💰 STRIKE SELECTION

## 📌 Strike Selection Formula

**🧮 Formula:**  
```
Select Strike ≈ Spot Price ± (1 * ATM Premium)
```

**Example:**  
Spot = 22,000 | ATM Premium ≈ ₹120  
- ATM = 22,000  
- 1 Step ITM = 21,900 (premium costlier but safer)
- 1 Step OTM = 22,100 (cheaper but needs strong breakout)

Use **ITM** when:
- Premium is affordable
- Trend is confirmed
- You want higher delta (move with price)
- Safer for beginners (lower time decay risk)

🔺Use **ATM** when:
- Move has started
- PCR/OI/volume confirms trend
- Want good delta at lower cost

🔻Avoid **OTM** when:
- Near expiry (faster decay)
- Weak trend or not clear
- Low volume

## 🧾 Bottom Line (2025 Rule for Option Buyers)

> **"Buy with price action, volume, and OI support — not with hope."**

☑️ Must-Do Before Buying:
- Trend confirmed on chart
- Strong volume
- OI rising
- Reasonable PCR and IV
- Never skip stop-loss
- Avoid low-volume far OTM traps
- Time the move early in the week (to beat theta)
- Monday/Tuesday Entry: Enter early in the week to maximize time value before theta decay increases

# 📉 Option Greeks Quick Guide (Buyer View)

| Greek     | What It Measures                             | Buyer Strategy                                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delta** | Option's price sensitivity to the underlying | 🔼 Higher Delta (0.5–0.7) = Better for CE/PE near ATM or ITM               |
| **Theta** | Time decay (loss in value as expiry nears)   | 🔻 Lower Theta is better for buyers (avoid near expiry trades)             |
| **Vega**  | Impact of IV (Implied Volatility) changes    | 🔼 Buy when IV is low (you gain if IV rises after your entry)              |
| **Gamma** | Rate of Delta change                         | 📈 Higher Gamma = faster delta moves, ideal for momentum early in the week |

## 🧠 Quick Tips for Buyers:

* ✅ **High Delta** = More price-sensitive (better returns)
* ⚠️ **High Theta** = Faster premium decay (be cautious near expiry)
* ✅ **Low Vega Entry** = Good if expecting IV rise
* 📈 **High Gamma** early in the week = Faster option movement with price

# 🌀 What is Implied Volatility (IV)?

* **IV** reflects the market's **expectation of future price movement** (volatility) of the underlying asset.
* Higher IV = Market expects **big moves**
* Lower IV = Market expects **less movement**

## 📊 IV Impact for Option Buyers

| IV Level       | Impact on Option Premium | Buyer Strategy                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **High IV**    | Expensive Premiums 🔺    | ❌ Risky for buyers (Overpaying)  |
| **Low IV**     | Cheap Premiums 🔻        | ✅ Ideal for buying (Undervalued) |
| **Rising IV**  | Premium Increases 🔼     | ✅ Good if you already bought     |
| **Falling IV** | Premium Drops 🔽         | ❌ Bad if you're holding options  |

## ✅ How to Use IV in Decision Making

* **Buy CE/PE when IV is low**, and you're expecting a breakout or news event.
* **Avoid buying when IV is already high**, unless you're confident in a very large move.
* **Check Vega**: The Greek that tells how sensitive the premium is to changes in IV.

## 🔁 Example Scenario

* **Spot = 22,000**
* CE 22,000 ATM option:

  * IV = 25% → Premium ₹100
  * IV = 35% → Premium ₹140+
* If you bought at low IV and IV increases, your option value rises **even without price movement**.

## 🎯 Bottom Line for IV:

> "**As an option buyer, your best friend is *low IV* before a big move. Your worst enemy is *high IV* before a flat market.**"
