# 🔶 **THE TRADER’S CODE**

*A disciplined trader doesn't chase trades. A disciplined trader survives.*

Your personal trading philosophy, formatted as premium behavioral guidelines:

```
1. Never trade when your emotional, mental, or energetic state is disturbed. 
   A disturbed mind leads to disturbed decisions.

2. Follow your tried and tested criteria strictly. 
   Rules protect you from yourself.

3. If any of your criteria don’t align, skip the trade. 
   Patience is a profitable position.

4. When market conditions are rough, stay out. 
   You don’t have to trade every day.

5. Never risk above a fixed percentage of your account balance. 
   Capital protection is your first job.

6. Regularly evaluate the environment (“sandpit”) you operate in. 
   Markets change; your awareness must too.

7. Stay away from retail forums/groups filled with noise. 
   Noise clouds judgement and weakens conviction.

8. Keep your approach ridiculously simple. 
   Simplicity scales; complexity breaks.

9. Practice meditation or at least ten minutes of quiet time daily. 
   Mental control is a core trading edge.

10. Always have an exit strategy before entering a trade.
    The exit defines the outcome, not the entry.

# 🔶 **1. WHY RISK MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL IN OPTIONS TRADING**

## **1.1 Options Are Leveraged Instruments**

Options allow small capital to control large positions (lot sizes).
This leverage can produce high returns, but the same leverage can multiply losses even more aggressively.

A tiny unfavorable move in the underlying can cause:
• Fast premium decay
• Sharp MTM losses
• Violent swings

This is why options require far stricter risk rules compared to equities.

---

## **1.2 Complex Payoff Structures**

Options aren’t linear like stocks.
Each strategy has its own payoff shape, risk curve, and breakeven levels.

Examples:

* Buying a call is different from selling a naked put
* Spreads behave differently than straddles
* Time sensitivity makes each setup unique

Because the payoff is non-linear, even correct direction can still result in loss due to volatility or time decay.

---

## **1.3 Time Decay and Volatility Risks**

Options come with additional sensitivities:  
✅ **Theta (time decay)**  
✅ **Vega (volatility risk)**  

A stock can stay flat, yet your option premium **decreases every day**.
Similarly, IV crush after events like earnings can wipe out premium even if price moves in the expected direction.

This makes risk management essential, not optional.

---

## **1.4 Black Swan Events**

Sudden unpredictable events can cause massive gaps.
Examples:
• Crashes
• War news
• Elections
• Flash crashes
• Major earnings surprises

Such moves can produce **unlimited losses** for naked sellers.
Even defined-risk traders can suffer if they oversize positions.

Risk limits protect you from rare but catastrophic events.

---

# 🔶 **2. TYPES OF RISK IN OPTIONS TRADING**

## **2.1 Market Risk (Directional Risk)**

This is the risk of the underlying moving against your trade direction.
A call buyer loses when the underlying falls or stays flat.
A put buyer loses when price rises or stays flat.

Even small sideways movement hurts option buyers due to theta decay.

---

## **2.2 Volatility Risk**

Options are highly sensitive to changes in implied volatility.
A drop in IV reduces premium immediately.
This is known as **IV crush**, common after events.

Options with high Vega (ATM, long-dated) are more exposed.

---

## **2.3 Time Decay Risk (Theta Risk)**

Options lose value as time passes.
Theta accelerates as expiration nears.
This risk affects buyers heavily, especially OTM options.

Sellers benefit from theta, but only if their direction and volatility assumptions are correct.

---

## **2.4 Liquidity Risk**

Options with wide bid-ask spreads can be costly to enter or exit.
Low liquidity leads to:

* Higher slippage
* Difficulty in adjusting trades
* Poor fill prices
* Reduced profit potential

Example:
If bid = ₹95 and ask = ₹105, you may lose ₹10 instantly upon entering.
This directly increases effective risk and reduces expectancy.

Avoid illiquid strikes, especially far OTM options or low-volume expiries.

---

## **2.5 Assignment Risk**

Short options may be assigned early (American-style).
This can cause unexpected stock/futures exposure.
Poorly positioned assignment can disrupt your entire risk plan.

---

## **2.6 Execution Risk**

Fast market conditions can cause:

* Partial fills
* Missed fills
* Slippage
* Execution delays

This is common during:
• Open
• Close
• High IV events
• Sudden news candles

---

# 🔶 **3. CORE PRINCIPLES OF RISK MANAGEMENT**

## **3.1 Define Risk Per Trade**

Use fixed % of capital: typically **1–3 percent**.
This keeps drawdowns manageable and ensures survival during losing streaks.

---

## **3.2 Use Stop Loss or Mental Stop**

For long options:
• Exit when 50 percent of premium is lost
• Prevents total premium wipe-out

For spreads:
• Max loss is predefined
• You can position size with precision

Stops protect capital and enforce discipline.

---

## **3.3 Diversify Strategies and Sectors**

Avoid clustering trades like:

* 5 bullish trades
* All Bank Nifty positions
* All high IV trades

Correlation kills.
Mixed setups reduce portfolio shocks.

---

## **3.4 Control Emotional Risk**

Fear, greed, FOMO, and revenge trading cause more damage than market volatility.
Pre-planned risk rules reduce emotional decision-making.

---

## **3.5 Trade With a Written Plan**

A proper plan includes:

* Entry conditions
* Exit plan
* Stop-loss levels
* Target logic
* Risk calculations
* Market context
* Reason for trade

Clear planning reduces confusion under stress.

---

# 🔶 **4. POSITION SIZING (THE REAL SUPERPOWER)**

Position sizing controls how many lots/contracts you trade.
It defines **how much you lose when you're wrong**.

Small sizing = long survival
Oversizing = fast blow-up

---

## **4.1 Position Sizing Formula**

```
Maximum Risk Per Trade = Account Size × % Risk
Position Size = Maximum Risk ÷ Risk Per Contract
```

### 📌 Example

Capital = 1,00,000  
Risk per trade = 2 percent = 2,000  
Premium = ₹100  
Stop = 50 percent → ₹50 loss  

Risk per contract = 50 × 100 = 5,000  
→ Cannot take 1 lot  
→ Pick lower premiums or reduce stop percent  

---

# 🔶 **5. POSITION SIZING FOR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES**

## **5.1 Long Options (Calls/Puts)**

Longest risk exposure:

* High theta
* High IV dependency
* Must assume premium loss of 50–100 percent

Sizing rule:  
✅ Never risk more than **2 percent** on OTM options  
✅ Keep positions small  

---

## **5.2 Debit and Credit Spreads**

Spreads reduce risk but must be sized carefully.

**Debit spreads:**
Risk = premium paid

**Credit spreads:**
Risk = width of spread − credit received

### Example

Sell 18000 CE @ ₹200  
Buy 18100 CE @ ₹100  
Credit = ₹100  
Max loss = ₹100 × 100 = ₹10,000  
Risk allowed = ₹2,000  
→ Max size = 0.2 lots → not feasible  

This teaches sizing discipline.

---

## **5.3 Naked Selling**

* Unlimited risk (especially naked calls)
* High margin requirement
* Should be avoided by retail traders
* If used, size extremely small

Better alternative:  
✅ Use defined-risk credit spreads  
✅ Use hedged structures  

---

# 🔶 **6. ADJUST POSITION SIZE BASED ON CONDITIONS**

## **6.1 Volatility Adjusted Sizing**

High IV = more uncertainty → reduce size
Low IV = more predictable → normal size

Use:
• VIX
• India VIX
• IV Rank

This keeps risk adaptive instead of static.

---

## **6.2 Kelly Criterion (Advanced)**

Formula:

```
f* = (bp - q) / b
b = reward/risk ratio
p = probability of winning
q = 1 - p
```

Kelly maximizes growth but is too aggressive for real markets.
Use:  
✅ Half Kelly  
✅ Fixed fractional sizing  

---

# 🔶 **7. HEDGING METHODS**

## **7.1 Protective Puts**

Buy a put to hedge long stock or futures.
Acts like insurance; limits downside.

---

## **7.2 Covered Calls**

Sell call against stock holdings.
Reduces breakeven and generates consistent income.

---

## **7.3 Collars**

Buy put + sell call
Creates a controlled risk “tunnel”, ideal for capital protection.

---

# 🔶 **8. PORTFOLIO LEVEL RISK MANAGEMENT**

## **8.1 Limit Overall Exposure**

Never expose more than 30–50 percent of capital at once.
Leave room for repairs and adjustments.

---

## **8.2 Watch for Correlation**

Avoid stacking:

* Multiple bullish trades
* Same index exposure
* Similar sector exposure

If one sector falls, all correlated trades collapse.

---

## **8.3 Delta Neutrality (Advanced)**

Balancing long and short deltas creates a stable portfolio less affected by direction.

---

# 🔶 **9. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES**

## **Example 1: TCS Long Call**

Premium = ₹40
SL = ₹20
Lot = 300
Max loss = ₹6,000
Risk allowed = ₹2,000
→ Position too large; avoid trade or reduce premium

---

## **Example 2: Nifty Credit Spread**

Sell 17800 CE @ 120
Buy 17900 CE @ 60
Net credit = 60

Max loss = (100 − 60) × 50 = ₹2,000

Risk limit = 2 percent
→ One lot safe

---

# 🔶 **10. PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK AND DISCIPLINE**

A trader may know technicals, greeks, and strategies, yet fail due to psychology.

Key rules:  
✅ Accept small losses  
✅ Never revenge trade  
✅ Stick to sizing rules  
✅ Don’t increase size after wins  
✅ Don’t shrink excessively after losses  
✅ Maintain consistency  
✅ Keep a journal  

Mindset is a bigger edge than strategy.

---

# 🔶 **CONCLUSION**

Risk management is the backbone of profitable options trading.
Direction helps create profit, but risk management ensures survival.

The top traders in the world don’t obsess over potential gains.

They obsess over:  
✅ “How much can I lose?”  
✅ “How do I stay in the game long term?”  

Master risk before profit.
Master sizing before strategy.

Your longevity in the market depends on it.
